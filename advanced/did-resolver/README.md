# â¬… DID Resolver

## Overview

DID methods are expected to provide [standards-compliant methods of DID and DID Document ("DIDDoc") production](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#production-and-consumption).

The [cheqd DID Resolver](https://github.com/cheqd/did-resolver) is designed to implement the [W3C DID _Resolution_ specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/) for [`did:cheqd`](../../architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method.md) method. It also supports full DID URL dereferencing, [defined in our ADR here](../../architecture/adr-list/adr-005-did-resolution-and-did-url-dereferencing.md).
