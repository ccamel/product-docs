# 3.x

The upgrade is broken down into three primary areas of development:

1. **EIP-1559-Style Burn Mechanism**: Inspired by Ethereum’s model, any network transaction—whether a transfer, proof-of-stake delegation, or identity ledger update—will burn $CHEQ tokens, including “credential payments,” ensuring consistent protocol revenue via token burns.
2. **Fee Abstraction**: Anyone with a Cosmos token can now pay for transactions on the cheqd network, with these tokens converted into $CHEQ as needed. This feature enables stable payments using tokens like USDC, EUROe, or EURC, providing greater payment flexibility.
3. **General Burn Transaction**: A new option to burn $CHEQ tokens on demand, expanding use cases for token management.
