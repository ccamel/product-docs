# ðŸ†” DIDs

[Decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers).
