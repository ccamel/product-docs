# ü§ù Build Trust Registries

Trust Registries enable a Relying Party to determine the authenticity of a legal entity within a digital credential ecosytem. Trust Registries are crucial to establish for production environments, because they add extra levels of assurance to the authenticity of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).&#x20;
