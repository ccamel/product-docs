# Accreditation and Issuance Policies

Accreditation Policies are included in each "Verifiable Accreditation" or "Verifiable Credential" within the `termsOfUse` section of the credential. The Accreditation Policies reference the other members of the Trust Chain, so that a Relying Party can traverse the Trust Chain.
