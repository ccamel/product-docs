# Governance Framework

## Overview

[ToIP recommends making Governance Frameworks available through DID URLs](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=71241), which would typically be a text file, a [Markdown file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), PDF etc. This, for example, can enable parties building self-sovereign identity ecosystems to use DIDs to reference Governance Frameworks they conform to, at different levels of the technical stack.
